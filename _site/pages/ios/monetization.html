<p><em>by Hillel Fuld FEB. 6, 2011</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In December 2010, the top 300 free applications generated over 3 million downloads, ten times more than the paid ones. Hillel Fuld debunks some myths and explains the best practices that developers of free apps have used to maximize their revenue and user engagement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The mobile app ecosystem is thriving. According to Gartner, worldwide mobile app revenue will exceed $15 billion in 2011. Distimo reports that in December 2010 alone, the top 300 free applications generated over 3 million downloads, ten times more than the paid ones. Gartner also points out that more than 80 percent of mobile apps are free. So this begs the question, if developers are offering their apps for free, how do they make money?</p>

<p>Developers looking to monetize their free apps can use in-app advertising, in app purchases, or a freemium version.</p>

<p>With the predictions for the mobile advertising space to hit $5.4 billion by 2015 in the U.S alone, mobile advertising is the way to go.</p>

<p>At inneractive, we specialize in generating more revenue from mobile apps by optimizing over 60 global ad networks and local agencies in one simple SDK. Through our work, we have learned many crucial lessons about what works in mobile advertising.</p>

<p>Mobile Ads 101 The following concepts are crucial to understanding mobile advertising:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>eCPM (Effective cost per mille): The revenue the developer receives per every 1000 impressions.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>CTR (Click-through rate): This is obtained by dividing the number of users who clicked on an ad by the number of total impressions. The primary contributor to a high CTR is the relevancy of the ad and the ad placement strategy. In order to increase the relevancy of ads, the campaign should be of a premium and local nature: You want to display ads to users in their native language, and the topic of the ads should be relevant to the type of app in which the ad appears. In terms of the ad placement strategy, the location and format (text vs banner) of the ad also have a significant effect on the overall CTR. For this, it is important that you work with a company that will walk you through the process following the integration in order to maximize the effects of the ads.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Global Fill Rate: The percentage of the total ad inventory that is populated by paying ads. Due to many different factors, in some instances ads will either not appear at all, or a &#8220;house ad&#8221; essentially a self-promotional ad, will appear in its place. If your app has a 100 percent global fill rate, out of which 60 percent are house ads (a common number in this case), you are essentially leaving that 60 percent of your potential revenue on the table. In fact, a lower fill rate with all “paid ads” is more effective than a high fill rate with house ads. So don’t be misled by a high fill rate; the paid ads are the only ones that count.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id='games_generate_more_clicks'>Games generate more clicks</h4>

<p>Let’s start with types of apps. Among the 300,000 iOS apps and the 200,000 Android apps, there are many different categories. There are games, utilities, tools, social, entertainment — the list goes on. Each app category has different results when it comes to its CTR.</p>

<p>Our stats indicate that in terms of CTR, the following categories are the top ones for developers: - Entertainment - Tools - Sports - Arcade and Action - News and Info - Brain and Puzzles</p>

<p>We consistently find that games (which fall under both Entertainment as well as Arcade and Action) produce the highest CTR, which isn’t terribly surprising since a user is more likely to engage with an ad that appears in between levels of the game or on the Game Over screen, for example. If your app is social or is an eBook app, other revenue streams, such as in-app purchases, might be more relevant.</p>

<h4 id='focus_on_the_primary_countries'>Focus on the primary countries</h4>

<p>In terms of geographies, the following locations consistently produce a relatively high CTR, and advertisers recognize the quality of the clicks from the following locations by paying more per click: - U.S - UK - Italy - Spain - South Africa - Australia</p>

<p>What this means for developers is that when designing and marketing your app, the above countries should be taken into account. That includes in app translations for the relevant languages and targeted marketing campaigns in those specific countries.</p>

<h4 id='more_tips_to_get_more_traction_from_your_apps'>More tips to get more traction from your apps</h4>

<p>These tips are crucial for maximizing your app revenue, but there are of course other tips we have found to be very useful in terms of gaining traction.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Engage your audience with frequent updates and promotions. This keeps your audience interested and loyal. The obvious example of an app that excels at this is Angry Birds with constant and frequent updates.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Develop cross-platform. Despite the buzz around one or two operating systems, it is extremely effective to develop a cross-platform app that supports OSes such as Symbian and BlackBerry. In fact, we have found that these platforms have higher CTRs, as users are not as “ad-blind” as iPhone or Android users. Generally speaking, we have found that the early adopter tech community pays less attention to ads than other types of users.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Create web and native apps. While native apps are often more robust and responsive, Web apps using HTML5 can also yield a positive response from your audience. However, we have found that for games, the native model works better with faster response times and an overall more robust experience.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Enable sharing. Give your users tools to easily share your app across their social platforms. Add some integrated options to tweet or share the app on Facebook. This will provide a very effective method of spreading the word about your app. Some good examples of this are news and info apps that have an option to tweet the article and the tweet then includes the name of the app.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In today’s super competitive mobile space, developers need an edge to get ahead of the competition. I hope these pointers provided that edge.</p>

<h1 id='5_ways_to_increase_clicks_and_boost_revenue_in_mobile_advertising'>5 Ways to Increase Clicks and Boost Revenue in Mobile Advertising</h1>

<p>Anyone who has ever advertised anywhere knows that the main challenge is getting eyeballs on your ad. This is true for old school advertising such as newspapers, billboards, and TV promos, and it is just as true for digital advertising. The name of the game in digital advertising whether on the Web or mobile is CTR, click through rate.</p>

<p>You can advertise all you want, but if no one is clicking, you are wasting your time. Of course, traffic is also important because some campaigns are per impressions, but in any case, the assumption is, the more traffic you get to your site or app, the more impressions and the more clicks…. That is generally the case. The big question is how to increase the percentage of people that see your ad and actually click on it?</p>

<p>The truth is, many of the guidelines I will mention below are true for Web as well, but I am talking specifically about mobile in-app advertising. The following are some golden tips to increase your CTR and thereby boost your revenue:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Location, location, location: The location of your ad is crucial. Take a game for example. Imagine you are right in the middle of playing yourself a nice challenging game of let’s say, Angry Birds. While your sole focus is to kill those pigs, chances are you are not looking for any ads along the bottom of the app. In fact, even if an ad pops up on the screen and blocks your access to the birds, chances are, all you are going to do is close the ad.Â However, imagine the following scenario. You are playing a baseball game app and as soon as you pass the first stage, you are presented with an ad for discount tickets on a baseball game in your city. All of a sudden, the chances that you will click on that ad grew dramatically. As a developer, when choosing a company to work with you on your mobile advertising, make sure part of their offering is ad placement, otherwise, you are leaving money on the table.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Relevancy: Continuing the above example. If, in the second case, the ad was not for baseball game tickets, but rather for a new ballet that is performing in your city, what are the chances of you clicking? Not very high, huh? It is important to target mobile ads to the consumer seeing them. This is possible by using the person’s location, their type of mobile phone, as well as the type of app in which the ad appears. This is also crucial when it comes to mobile advertising entities since if the company does not target campaigns to users, what might end up happening is that children might encounter adult-oriented ads or even worse. This is yet another important factor in choosing a company to run your mobile advertising campaigns. They must have premium content andÂ targetingÂ abilities.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Appearance: In this case, looks matter and they matter a lot. One of the reasons certain mobile devices do so well is because of their intuitive user interface. In fact, the same principle applies to mobile apps. If a user opens an app and does not know what to do within seconds, most users will close the app and probably delete it. The last thing a user or a developer wants is an ad that ruins the look of the app and the user’s experience. In- app advertising is a relatively new industry, so many of the big players in the space offer ads that areÂ estheticallyÂ unpleasing to say the least. As a developer, before releasing an app with in-app advertising, try it out and see how the ads look. If they are not to your satisfaction, then make sure to improve them before releasing the app. The last thing you want is to lose users just because you wanted to monetize your hard work.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Attendance: Here is the thing with mobile ads, they do not always appear. If, for example, your ad network is operational in the U.S only and someone downloads your app in Japan. The best case scenario is that the person will see an app that is completely irrelevant to them. The worse option is that they will see no ad at all. That is what is called Fill Rate and it is important to Â ensure that your mobile advertising company has a high fill rate. Wait, it gets more complicated. Some companies quote a 100% fill rate, but when you dig deeper, you find that 40% of those ads are house ads that are just advertising themselves. You know what that means for you the developer? No revenue. So not only is fill rate crucial, but making sure the ads are all revenue-generating ads is something you must pay attention to.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Performance: Due to the relatively young industry, companies are still learning the ropes and the consumers are the ones suffering. If you have ads in your app that either do not appear correctly, are not optimized for the device’s display, or simply do not do what they are supposed to, you are simply losing out on revenue that could have been yours. In order to ensure the quality and performance of your ads, test them, QA them, and test them some more. When you click, does it redirect you to the appropriate location. Do all the graphics appear correctly? These are questions you must ask yourself before releasing an app with built in ads.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Interactivity: We saw this to be true with Web advertising and it equally applies to mobile ads. If you have rich media, HTML 5, or any other type of ad that engages the user, you will see an automatic increase in CTR. This makes sense since users react well to interactive experiences, just take a look at CTR rates on the iPad compared to phones. A bigger screen, more room for user interaction, more click throughs. Once again, when choosing an entity to oversee your mobile advertising efforts, make sure to ask what type of ads they serve. Are they just text ads? Banners with graphics? HTML 5? Video? And the list goes on.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>These are some tips we have found to be useful here at inneractive both from a developer’s perspective and from our side when developing our SDKs. We work closely with our developers on ad placement, so they can be sure they are generating the maximum number of clicks and revenue. We work with premium ad networks and local agencies to ensure that our ads are of the utmost quality and our developers can vouch for that. We pride ourselves on our 90% global fill rate, which are exclusively revenue-generating ads for the developer. Lastly, we perform QA and ongoing testing of all our ads and now support rich media across all platforms…</p>
