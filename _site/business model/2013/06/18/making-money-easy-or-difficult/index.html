<h3 id='selling_virtual_possessions'>Selling Virtual Possessions</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Premium WordPress Themes. Looking at Themeforest author sales, some of them are hitting $100k/month and they are not seasoned (at least in ThemeForest).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Premium WordPress Plugins. <a href='https://tri.be/wordpress-events-calendar/'>These guys</a> used to sell on CodeCanyon and it looks like their product took off quite well (selling $20K/month last year)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='blogging'>Blogging</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href='http://goinswriter.com/get-paid-passion/'>http://goinswriter.com/get-paid-passion/</a>. I built the audience first. I’d heard stories of people like Brian Clark who built their audiences long before they tried to sell , and I thought that sounded smart. For more than a year, I wrote a LOT of free, helpful content (i.e. eBooks, newsletters, blog posts, guest posts, webinars, and more) and shared it with my audience. The result was a tremendous amount of trust — to the point that people started begging me to sell them something. I asked my audience what they wanted. Sean Platt told me to do this, recommending a survey to ask people what they’d buy from me, even how much I should charge them. Over 1000 people responded, many indicating (to my utter shock) they would indeed pay for something I created. That gave me the confidence to try something. I experimented with an initial offering. My first product was a $2.99 eBook (which I seriously doubted people would buy). Based on the concept of a minimum viable product, I put together an offering that required minimal effort to create and then put it out there to see if people would buy it. The money I made from the first weekend it was released paid for my email marketing service for an entire year (about $1500). After that, everything changed. A hobby became a business. I learned how to launch things. After that first eBook, I released another eBook but with three different price points (based on Chris Guillebeau’s advice) and a few other tweaks. This generate ten times the sales that the first product did — in a matter of a few weeks. It also taught me how to harness the power of an online product launch (which I’ve since used on my book and online course). Learning how to launch was the golden nugget I was missing that led to sustainable, repeatable success in my business.</p>

<p><a href='http://goinswriter.com/make-money-blogging/'>http://goinswriter.com/make-money-blogging/</a>. Affiliate marketing: Selling other people’s products for them and earning a commission on each sale. My Amazon story is an example of this. I’m also starting to see some fruit from promoting other products I believe in, like 31 Days to Build a Better Blog. Product sales: Sell your own products (eBooks, webinars, iPhone apps, whatever). I’m working on a few of these myself. The trick is delivering value and only giving your community what they want. Advertising: If you have decent traffic, you can sell ad space. (I’ve just started exploring this, but so far it’s been fruitful. Recently, to jump-start my advertising, I offered a 50% discount on Cyber Monday.) Market your own services: If selling stuff makes your skin crawl, you can use a blog to build an online presence and brand and then use it to land consulting or freelance services. (I’ve had several people contact me about things like writing an eBook, SEO, and other topics I’ve written about.)</p>
