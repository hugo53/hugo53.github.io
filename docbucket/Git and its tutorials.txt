Nowadays, Git becomes very popular for managing source-code in not only IT Industry but also universities, academies. By this reason, Git is really important for all who want to work faster, smarter and in bigger projects. However, Git is not easy to control if you are not familiar with sourcecode management, even if you used to do with svn, it is still difficult. This post, I list some good tutorials for a wide range of Git's users, from newbie to intermediate to advance guys. 

By the way, there are several manual books should be translated into Vietnamese (my mother tongue) due to Git's difficulty. Thus, if you are interested in this job, please contact me to make a plan for working together. I think it will be very great moment of us. 

- [Git SCM Book] (http://git-scm.com/book/) and its [source](https://github.com/progit/progit) (no _vi_ folder existing until now - Sep 28, 2013). This is official document from  Git's creators. 
- [Git Ready](http://gitready.com/) and its [source](https://github.com/gitready/gitready) (no _vi_ branch existing until now - Sep 28, 2013). This tutorial divides lessons into 3 levels: beginner, intermediate, advance with specific use-cases, easy to apply on real projects. 

Besides, there is a book which is already in Vietnamese by contribution of [Mr. Tran Ngoc Quan](http://vnwildman.users.sourceforge.net/). It is located at [here](http://vnwildman.users.sourceforge.net/gitmagic/index.html). The original guidline is of [Ben Lynn](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~blynn/gitmagic/) - a Stanford alumnus.
