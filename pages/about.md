### An IT man
First of all, I am an IT man. Sounds bad, but it is true. Why bad? Because IT man is always poor in not only time but also money. Is it truly bad, huh? But not problem, 'I'm poor but I have a dream, even a big big big dream'. That quote always stands on my mouth.

### An IDEA-guy
It is crazy, but true also. It is not good when I usually get new idea in mind. In most cases, it leads to over-minding state that make me be mad. Thus, I cannot implement any idea, for now. Terribly!  However, ideas come like God's presents for me. So, dream about a day I sell my idea to some reliable guys who can make them true. 

### Or an love-loser?
Alright, love-loser, no any badge can more approriate to assign. So funny. I have no skill to date a cute girl. No way, I should be single forever, but I'm not an FA, remember that!
