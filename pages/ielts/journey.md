One month ago, I decided to leave job for preparing an exam called IELTS. Although I awared that making a detail plan is necessary extremely, this time I still do not have any suitable plan for tracking journey of acquiring high IELTS score. It is terrible! 

Now, I think first two problems are grammar and vocabulary range. Grammar plays a vital role because it helps learners know exact meaning of statement without any difficulty. Similarly, vocabulary is highly necessary element in not only learning English but also acquiring other languages.
