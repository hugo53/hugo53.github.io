One month ago, I decided to leave job for preparing an exam called IELTS. Although I awared that making a detail plan is necessary extremely, this time I still do not have any suitable plan for tracking journey of acquiring high IELTS score. It is terrible! 

Now, I think first two problems are grammar and vocabulary range. Grammar plays a vital role because it helps learners know exact meaning of statement without any difficulty. Similarly, vocabulary is highly necessary element in not only learning English but also acquiring other languages. 




### How do I master grammar in 3 days?
Admittedly, grammar is one of essential parts not only in English but also in all of other languages (other part can be mentioned here is vocabulary). Thus, mastering grammar is required for any IELTS learner who intends to obtain a high score.

This section is for talking about how to master grammar in three days which was experienced myself.

Firstly, you must decide what documents which you are about to use. In my outlook, _Grammar for IELTS_ is a great book to achieve that purpose. However, going through the book entirely is extremely boring. Thus, I recommend that you should ultilize several optional resources which are listed as follows. 

- [Anglo-Link's Youtube Channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/MinooAngloLink?feature=watch). Watch and do all exercises are supplied. This channel is helpful actually.

Secondly, attempting to apply grammar rules for real situations is really necessary. Using grammar structure in your writing and speaking will help you remember those syntaxes and  produce correct sentences easily whenever you need.
