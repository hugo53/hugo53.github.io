One month ago, I decided to leave job for preparing an exam called IELTS. Although I was aware that making a detail plan is necessary extremely, this time I still do not have any suitable plan for tracking journey of acquiring high IELTS score. It is terrible! 

Now, I think first two problems are grammar and vocabulary range. Grammar plays a vital role because it helps learners know exact meaning of statement without any difficulty. Similarly, vocabulary is highly necessary element in not only learning English but also acquiring other languages. 




### How do I master grammar in 3 days?
Admittedly, grammar is one of essential parts not only in English but also in all of other languages (other part can be mentioned here is vocabulary). Thus, mastering grammar is required for any IELTS learner who intends to obtain a high score.

This section is for talking about how to master grammar in three days which was experienced myself.

Firstly, you must decide what documents which you are about to use. In my outlook, _Grammar for IELTS_ is a great book to achieve that purpose. However, going through the book entirely is extremely boring. Hence, I recommend that you should utilize several optional resources which are listed as follows. 

- [Anglo-Link's Youtube Channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/MinooAngloLink?feature=watch). Watch and do all exercises. This channel is helpful actually.

Secondly, attempting to apply grammar rules for real situations is really necessary. Using grammar structure in your writing and speaking will help you remember those syntaxes and  produce correct sentences easily whenever you need.

Additionally, knowing which grammar rules should be concentrated on is also important. You can find list of ones at [here](http://hugo53.github.io/pages/ielts/index.html).

### The way exploiting efficiently academic journals for gaining vocabulary and enriching ideas
There are two kinds of journals which can be used for learning English purpose. The first is [ScientificAmerican](http://www.scientificamerican.com/) which supplies a plenty of articles in science. The other one is [Economist](http://www.economist.com/) where we can browse many pieces of news in economics, politics and so forth.

### How to prepare vocabulary for IELTS Exam?

#### Academic Word List - A challenge must be beaten.




### Writing - the hardest skill
Indeed, there are many suggestions about what books should be used for training writing skill. For example, [this article](http://ieltsvietnam.net/sach-ielts-writing-khuyen-dung/) was analyzed three materials: Writing Right and two books of Gabi Duigu.
In my opinion, there best ones of those writing books are Academic Writing, Writing Samples (by Mark Clark) and Write Right. Additionally, book of ideas called _Ideas for IELTS_ by Simon whom is ex-examiner is really useful. Four books are sufficient for obtaining band 7+ in writing test.

In order to utilize those materials efficiently, I suggest that all above books should use as follows way:

#### Task 1



#### Task 2
1. Sentence Structure: Writing Academic
It will tell you how many types of sentence (Part 3, Chapter 10), how a good sentence be organized (Part 3, Chapter 11, 12, 13, 14, 15).

2. Producing right sentence to gain high band score: Write Right
3. Enriching ideas: Ideas for IELTS
4. Reading samples: Writing Samples.

### Phrasal Verb - How to learn in a efficient way?
First of all, you must have a good phrasal verb dictionary. I recommend [this page](http://www.usingenglish.com/reference/phrasal-verbs/) for looking up meaning of phrasal verbs. Besides, you can access this [site](http://www.eslcafe.com/pv/) for looking up phrasal verbs.
Moreover, the book called _Check your English vocabulary for phrasal verbs and idioms_ is also useful.
