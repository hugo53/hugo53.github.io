### Effectiveness vs Efficiency
The difference between efficient and effective is that efficiency refers to how well you do something, whereas effectiveness refers to how useful it is.
For example, if a company is not doing well and they decide to train their workforce on a new technology. The training goes really well - they train all their employees in record time and tests show they have absorbed the training well. But overall productivity doesn't improve. In this case the company's strategy was efficient but not effective. (http://www.diffen.com/difference/Effectiveness_vs_Efficiency)

These two qualitative adjectives are often confused, Kisy. If somebody or something is efficient, then he, she or it works in a well-organised way, without wasting time or energy. Consider the following examples:

'She was efficient in everything she did and was frequently commended for exemplary service to the organisation.'
'He hasn’t made very efficient use of his time in revising for these exams: he has made no notes and his concentration spans appear to last for no longer than ten minutes.'
'This engine is really efficient, it can run for 30 km on only 1 litre of fuel.'


If something is effective, it works well and produces the results that were intended. Consider the following examples:
'These tablets really are effective. My headache’s much better now.'
'The only effective way to avoid hay fever at this time of the year, if you are a sufferer, is to stay indoors.'

In Vietnamese, *effectiveness* means *có hiệu quả, hữu hiệu*. In other words, it refers to result of an activity. By comparison, *efficiency* means *hiệu quả, hiệu suất*. It refers to the way performing an activity.
