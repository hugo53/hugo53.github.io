### Effectiveness vs Efficiency
The difference between efficient and effective is that efficiency refers to how well you do something, whereas effectiveness refers to how useful it is.
For example, if a company is not doing well and they decide to train their workforce on a new technology. The training goes really well - they train all their employees in record time and tests show they have absorbed the training well. But overall productivity doesn't improve. In this case the company's strategy was efficient but not effective. (http://www.diffen.com/difference/Effectiveness_vs_Efficiency)

efficient – effective(http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/grammar/learnit/learnitv64.shtml)
These two qualitative adjectives are often confused, Kisy. 

If somebody or something is efficient, then he, she or it works in a _well-organised way_, without wasting time or energy. Consider the following examples:
'She was efficient in everything she did and was frequently commended for exemplary service to the organisation.'
'He hasn’t made very efficient use of his time in revising for these exams: he has made no notes and his concentration spans appear to last for no longer than ten minutes.'
'This engine is really efficient, it can run for 30 km on only 1 litre of fuel.'


If something is effective, it works _well and produces the results_ that were intended. Consider the following examples:
'These tablets really are effective. My headache’s much better now.'
'The only effective way to avoid hay fever at this time of the year, if you are a sufferer, is to stay indoors.'

In Vietnamese, *effectiveness* means *có hiệu quả, hữu hiệu*. In other words, it refers to result of an activity. By comparison, *efficiency* means *hiệu quả, hiệu suất*. It refers to the way performing an activity. 


### ADAPT/ADOPT & ADJUST

adapt (to) • adopt • adjust (to)
- We have adopted the same sort of assembly methods they use in Japan.
Chúng tôi đã theo những phương pháp lắp ráp cùng kiểu được sử dụng ở Nhật Bản.
(Không dùng “ adapted”)
(= taken and used: chấp nhận và sử dụng)
- We have adapted the assembly system they use in Japan to suit our circumstances here.
Chúng tôi cải biên lại dây chuyền lắp ráp sử dụng ở Nhật Bản cho hợp với điều kiện ở đây.
(Không dùng “ adopted”)
(= changed it to suit our needs: thay đổi cho phù hợp với yêu cầu của chúng tôi)
- I have found it difficult to adapt to/adjust to living in the country after living in a large city.
Tôi thấy khó thích nghi với cuộc sống ở nông thôn sau khi đã sống ở thành phố lớn

(= become used to: trở nên quen với)
- The picture is out of focus. Could you adjust it slightly please?
Hình ảnh không rõ nét, ông có thể chỉnh lại một chút được không?

### Terrific versus terrible
_It is terrific_ means the thing is very great.

### Personally and Personalty
Personally is an adverb, means _Với tư cách cá nhân_.

Personalty is a noun, means _động sản_. Its antonym is _realty_ (*bất động sản*, please do not confuse this word with *reality*).

### Reserve versus Reverse and Deserve versus Diverse
Opps, these couples always make learners confused. 
Firstly, reSERVE is a noun/verb, means *sự dự trữ, dự trữ* whereas reVERSE is a noun/verb/adj, means *sự đảo nghịch, đảo ngược, trái lại*.

deSERVE is a verb, means *xứng đáng* while dIVERSE is an adj, means *đa dạng, nhiều loại khác nhau*.


### Attempt or Attemption
Not surprisingly, many people think that _attemption_ is a correct word because it seems reasonable when adds _tion_ suffix after the root word _attempt_. In fact, _attempt_ is not only a verb but also a noun. Thus, noun form of the verb _attempt_ is exactly same it. By way of conclusion, _attemption_ is absolutely wrong. Using _attempt_ for both noun and verb role makes right grammar. 

### Ethic and Ethnic
_Ethic_ is a noun and is synonym of _morality_. _Ethnic_ is an adjective, means _thuộc dân tộc_. 



### Some words "*evoke": revoke, invoke, evoke
*revoke* : huỷ bỏ, thủ tiêu, rút lui (officially CANCEL)

*invoke* : viện dẫn (CITE), cầu khẩn (BEG)

*evoke* : gợi lên, gợi ra (BRING TO MIND), cũng là gọi hồn (evoke a spirit/deity)

### Infancy is antonym of fancy? Absolutely wrong!
*fancy* : (n, adj, v) LIKE, BELIEVE or sặc sỡ

*infancy*: (n) thời kỳ ban đầu, trẻ con. _Infancy of tidal energy production_
