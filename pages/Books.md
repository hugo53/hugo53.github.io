Undeniably, reading is a significant skill which people should master on the way to be perfect. When I was a child, one of my favourite was reading books and newspapers while all of my friends loved to playing many interesting traditional games. Almost books which I had read were kind of fiction novels, and sometimes comic books were also chosen. There were a number of famous titles that should be listed here, for example _Doreamon_, _Detective Conan_ and so forth. However, when I was 13, I began reading a little and that status became worse one year after. 

Recently, I thought that reading should be reverted and I decided to buy several best seller books and try to read through them. Nonetheless, many books are still in waiting list because of time limited. Therefore, I will use this page to keep the list in updating status.

## Books I should done and maybe you do, too!


### Technical Books (Computer Science)
_(No book until now)_

### Economic
- [Economix: How Our Economy Works (and Doesn't Work), in Words and Pictures](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0810988399). In my viewpoint, it is great book because of the way of organization. It is presented in comic form, thus this book is easy to follow. 




### Thinking Development
- [Outliers: The Story of Success](http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930). Cover many cases of successes. It is helpful for improving observation mindset.


### Self-help
_(No book until now)_
