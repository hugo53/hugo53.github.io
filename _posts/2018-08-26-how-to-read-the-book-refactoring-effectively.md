### Approach

Many people will read this book and try to memorize the 
steps to implement these patterns. Others will read this 
book and clamor for these larger refactorings to be 
added to existing programming tools. Both of these 
approaches are misguided. 
The true value of this book 
lies not in the actual steps to achieve a particular pattern 
but in understanding the thought processes that lead to 
those steps.
 By learning to think in the algebra of 
refactoring, you learn to solve design problems in 
behavior-preserving steps, and you are not bound by the 
small subset of actual problems that this book 

   So take these exemplars that Josh has 
laid out for you. Study them. 
Find the 
underlying patterns of refactoring that are 
occurring.
 Seek the insights that led to the 
particular steps. Donâ€™t use this as a reference book, but as a primer
represents.
