Aww, it seems very amazing when you traverse [Quora](http://quora.com) to face with many curious questions. In the spare time, I usually *quora* and sometimes I must burst into a laugh because of some stupid questions and a plenty of ridiculous answers. That is why I create this page to keep those things.

## Question 1 by Hugo's friend, LeoLink 
*My friend asked me that why windows didn't base on linux kernel. The reason he gave is he love gaming in Windows and like working in Linux. Any idea for a mixing OS?*

(Next questions will be updated asap)
