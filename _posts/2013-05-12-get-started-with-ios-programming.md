Recently, I had been decided what kind of software industry field which should be followed. There were actually two choices, whether Big Data belongs to Data Mining techniques or Mobile Development is with creating a large number of awesome applications for the rest. I spent a plenty of time for choosing the best of those. Finally, in the next year, I will concentrate totally on building mobile applications and even mobile games based on iOS platform. It really is difficult thought because of interesting of the former. In this post, I am willing to show my path to iOS tunnel.

## What about official tutorials from Apple? 
Ahh, Nothing to say about them. Very very very amazing and extremely useful. We can find those at [here](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapiOS/). Please pay attention to the horizontal axis where describes standard road to combat almost challenges of mobile development.
A frequent question is that *What is the starting point?*. It means that newbies doesn't know where should begin. In [*App Design*](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapiOS/chapters/DesignYourAppwithCare/DesignYourAppWithCare/DesignYourAppWithCare.html) section, Apple suggests that developers should make clearly their ideas firstly, then make action plan that may consider many parts of creating application process such as Data Model, rough interface, type of devices: iPhone or iPad or both, version OS supported: 4 or later, 5 or later, 6 or later, so forth. 

## Main trainning resources
There is a fact that finding a valueable instruction is a hard task obviously. I usually question that what resource can be put our belief to pursue. As follows, I will list primary resources which I think they may helpful.

- [Great instruction describes all of aspects that let newbies know exactly what they may need](http://looksok.wordpress.com/2012/12/22/best-iphoneios-programming-tutorials/)

- [Tutorials by *rnystrom* - a talent iOS application distribution](https://github.com/rnystrom/iOS-Best-Practices)

- [Of course, cannot forget Coding Together: Developing Apps for iPhone and iPad by Stanford named CS193P](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/coding-together-developing/id593208016)
