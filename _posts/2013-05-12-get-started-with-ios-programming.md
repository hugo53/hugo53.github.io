Recently, I had been decided what kind of software industry field which should be followed. There were actually two choices, whether Big Data belongs to Data Mining techniques or Mobile Development is with creating a large number of awesome applications for the rest. I spent a plenty of time for choosing the best of those. Finally, in the next year, I will concentrate totally on building mobile applications and even mobile games based on iOS platform. It really is difficult thought because of interesting of the former. In this post, I am willing to show my path to iOS tunnel.

## What about official tutorials from Apple? 
Ahh, Nothing to say about them. Very very very amazing and extremely useful. We can find those at [here](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapiOS/). Please pay attention to the horizontal axis where describes standard road to combat almost challenges of mobile development.
A frequent question is that *What is the starting point?*. It means that newbies doesn't know where should begin. In [*App Design*]{http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapiOS/chapters/DesignYourAppwithCare/DesignYourAppWithCare/DesignYourAppWithCare.html} section, Apple suggests that develpers should make clearly their ideas clearly, then make action plan that may consider many parts of making application process such as Data Model, rough interface, type of devices: iPhone or iPad or both, version OS supported: 4 or later, 5 or later, 6 or later, so forth.
