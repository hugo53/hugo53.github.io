Recently, I had been decided what kind of software industry field which should be followed. There were actually two choices, whether Big Data belongs to Data Mining techniques or Mobile Development is with creating a large number of awesome applications for the rest. I spent a plenty of time for choosing the best of those. Finally, in the next year, I will concentrate totally on building mobile applications and even mobile games based on iOS platform. It really is difficult thought because of interesting of the former. In this post, I am willing to show my path to iOS tunnel.

## What about official tutorials from Apple? 
Ahh, Nothing to say about them. Very very very amazing and extremely useful. We can find those at [here](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapiOS/). Please pay attention to the horizontal axis where describes standard road to combat almost challenges of mobile development.
A frequent question is that *What is the starting point?*. It means that newbies doesn't know where should begin. In [*App Design*](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapiOS/chapters/DesignYourAppwithCare/DesignYourAppWithCare/DesignYourAppWithCare.html) section, Apple suggests that developers should make clearly their ideas firstly, then make action plan that may consider many parts of creating application process such as Data Model, rough interface, type of devices: iPhone or iPad or both, version OS supported: 4 or later, 5 or later, 6 or later, so forth. 

## Main training resources
There is a fact that finding a valuable instruction is a hard task obviously. I usually question that what resource can be put our belief to pursue. As follows, I will list primary resources which I think they may helpful.

- [A great instruction describes all of aspects that let newbies know exactly what they may need](http://looksok.wordpress.com/2012/12/22/best-iphoneios-programming-tutorials/). Especially, author of the article also listed what worthy of lectures in CS193P course (be mentioned below)for pursuing. He also uploaded his mind map which was created when he attended this course.

- [Tutorials by *rnystrom* - a talent iOS application publisher](https://github.com/rnystrom/iOS-Best-Practices)

- [Of course, unforgettable Coding Together: Developing Apps for iPhone and iPad by Stanford named CS193P](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/coding-together-developing/id593208016)

#### Blog
- [Great blog by an IT Guru](http://zeroheroblog.com/)
- [Superb Blog](http://maniacdev.com/). Show a lot of code, sample project, design strategy, ...
- [Template IOS](http://www.honcheng.com/applications). Several awesome templates were distributed via Github.



## UI Design
Great great great book: _Designing the iPhone User Experience A User-Centered Approach to Sketching and Prototyping iPhone Apps_ by SUZANNE GINSBURG. This book has been using in Design Course at CMU. 
 
- [Introduction iOS Design by Ben Taylor](http://taybenlor.com/2013/05/21/designing-for-ios.html). It is cutting-edge document for any iOS developer and designer. Easy to follow and clear to comprehend, this tutorial is very helpful.

## Where can we get more precious knowledge and monetizing?
Source code and review apps with high income is [here](http://iosapptemplate.com/). For example, app _InstaInspire_ is analyzed at [here](http://iosapptemplate.com/2013/05/14/instainspire-photo-app-with-audio-recorder-feature-app-template/).

## Advertising

- [Mobile Advertising Dictionary](http://www.amobee.com/dictionary/)

- Some advertising approaches

	* Advertisement at the beginning or ending points. 
	_My experience is from running a cross-promotion network called AppFlood on Android. Banners ads are pointless... the CTR is too low. If you implement a full screen interstitial correctly (at the beginning or end of a game/app) we have seen seen CTRs as high as 45%. However, we are well above the industry average for these ads which typically run 3-8% on other networks. A lot of it depends on how you integrate the advertisement._

	* Full-page ads. 
	_Based on what I see on the InMobi network, as well as my conversations with developers, average CTRs for standard  (50x300) banner ads look like this: Android: 0.50%, iPhone: 0.75%. CTRs tend to be higher for full-page interstitial ads, as well as for ads on tablets._
