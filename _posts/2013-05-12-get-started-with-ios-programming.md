Recently, I had been decided what kind of software industry field which should be followed. There were actually two choices, whether Big Data belongs to Data Mining techniques or Mobile Development is with creating a large number of awesome applications for the rest. I spent a plenty of time for choosing the best of those. Finally, in the next year, I will concentrate totally on building mobile applications and even mobile games based on iOS platform. It really is difficult thought because of interesting of the former. In this post, I am willing to show my path to iOS tunnel.
