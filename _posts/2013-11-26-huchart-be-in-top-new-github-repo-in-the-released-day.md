By a chance, I reached [Github Archive](http://www.githubarchive.org), a github statistic page.

Suddenly, I saw my project called [HUChart](https://github.com/hugo53/HUChart) was in ```Top New Repositories```. It was really a surprise for me because that day was the first day my repo goes public. Althought it received a little bit of stars, but I hope it will help someone and of course, will get more stars and forks.
