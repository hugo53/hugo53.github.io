By a chance, I reached [Github Archive](http://www.githubarchive.org), a github statistic page.

Suddenly, I saw my project called [HUChart](https://github.com/hugo53/HUChart) was in ```Top New Repositories```. It was really a surprise for me because that day was the first day my repo goes public. Although it received a little bit of stars, but I hope it will help someone and of course, will get more stars and forks.

### FYI

[HUChart](https://github.com/hugo53/HUChart) is a simple chart library for iOS to draw semi-circle chart for some cases which has a LITTLE SPACE to make a full circle chart. With this library, you can customize a semi circle chart (so-called half pie chart) to make a suitable chart for available space in device screen where has not enough space to draw a full circle chart.

You can see [HUChart](https://github.com/hugo53/HUChart) at [here](https://github.com/hugo53/HUChart) and below is some screenshots.
