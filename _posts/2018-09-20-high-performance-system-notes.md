### Fun-fact
- [Netflix moved from Oracle to Cassandra](https://www.datastax.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/CS-Netflix.pdf?6)

> 	Netflix processes 10 Million transactions per second to give users the most personalized viewing experience. After failing to deliver constant uptime and performance with Oracle, Netflix reinvented it’s database platform on Apache Cassandra. Today, 95% of Netflix’s non-program data including movie ratings, bookmarks, and viewing history of all 48 million members are stored on DataStax Enterprise — and Netflix hasn’t experienced any outages since.
