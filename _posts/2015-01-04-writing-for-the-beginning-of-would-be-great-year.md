Heyza, new year came. That's it, it came no doubt there. The previous year is not really good, actually. 

This year, I will try something new every 60 days and do my best to start my first challenge. It would be awesome as my dream.

To make motivation, I opened this awesome list [https://github.com/hugo53/awesome-RemoteWork](https://github.com/hugo53/awesome-RemoteWork) for all crazy guys who are keen on remote working. Just wanted you know, I'm trying to be a travel engineer in this year, plan for Jun, 2015. Of course, nothing to say more, it got trending repo on the first opened day. All pull requests are welcome.

Let go for next station and next dream is going come true.
